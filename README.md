# MMF_InfoCamera
This tool will allow you to collect some information from your scene and display it in your camera view. You can add important parameters, add normal parameters and create metadata for your mantra nodes. In addition, there's a PARMmenu which will allow you to add the parameter to the camera just by right clicking and selecting the desired action inside the Info Tool drop down menu. 

The installation for this tool needs the following steps:
- Copy the code that you have in the node.py file and paste it inside a new tool that you can create on your custom shelf.
  - For better understanding, you'll need to create a new shelf. Then, you'll need to right click on top of it and select the new tool option.
  - Once you created it, go to the script tab and paste the code.
- If you want to be able to create the node using the tab key, you'll need to use the context tab from the tool and tick the SOP option.
- Drop the MMFTools/infoCamera inside your $HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR (eg. C:/Users/%username%/Documents/houdiniX.X/)
- Drop the PARMmenu.xml inside your $HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR (eg. C:/Users/%username%/Documents/houdiniX.X/)
