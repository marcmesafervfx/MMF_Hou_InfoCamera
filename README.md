# MMF_InfoCamera
This tool will allow you to collect some information from your scene and display it in your camera view. You can add important parameters, add normal parameters and create metadata for your mantra nodes. In addition, there's a PARMmenu which will allow you to add the parameter to the camera just by right clicking and selecting the desired action inside the Info Tool drop down menu.
